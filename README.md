# Delivery Driver

## Overview
**Delivery Driver** is a simple 2D top-down game developed using Unity. In this game, players control a car from a top-down perspective to pick up packages and deliver them to customers. The project was created as part of a Unity 2D learning course on Udemy.

## Current Features
- **Top-Down Perspective**: The game uses a top-down view, where the car, houses, trees, and roads are visible from above.
- **Car Movement**:
  - The car can move forward, backward, left, and right.
  - Turning left or right creates a circular motion effect.
- **Package and Customer System**:
  - Two types of rectangles represent the Package and the Customer.
  - Players can pick up one package at a time and deliver it to a customer.
  - A new package can only be picked up after the current package has been delivered.
  - The car's color changes when a package is picked up and returns to its original color once the package has been delivered.
- **Boost Mechanic**: Players can collect a circular boost item to temporarily increase the car's speed.
- **Static Object Placement**: Packages, customers, and boosts are manually placed on the map (not randomized).
- **Environment**: The game features basic environmental elements such as houses, roads, rocks, and trees (2-3 variations).

## Project Purpose
This project was developed as a hands-on exercise to apply concepts learned in a Unity 2D course on Udemy. It focuses on understanding basic mechanics, physics, and object interaction in a 2D game environment.

## Planned Features
- **Randomized Object Placement**: Automate the placement of packages, customers, and boosts in random locations.
- **Level System**: Introduce multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Add moving obstacles or additional challenges on the road.
- **Scoring System**: Implement a scoring mechanism for successful deliveries.
- **Timer**: Add a time limit to complete deliveries.
- **Upgrades**: Allow players to upgrade the carâ€™s speed, durability, or boost duration.
- **Enhanced Graphics**: Improve the visual design of the car, packages, and environment.

## Notes
This project is a practice exercise and not a full-fledged game. It was created as part of a learning course on Udemy. In the future, I will be making updates to make the game more playable, as it currently lacks basic features such as a splash screen, exit button, and scoring system. However, major updates, such as adding many levels or a full release, are not planned, as this game is strictly a learning project. Updates will be focused on improving playability, but they will not happen in the near future due to other commitments. There is no specific timeline for when updates will be made. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are highly appreciated.
